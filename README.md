## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This is a years-long passion project where I'm finally building the note-taking application I've always wanted to create. I'm using this opportunity to learn Rust, a language I'm less familiar with, while working on something I'm truly passionate about.

As I gain more experience building this type of application and working in Rust, I plan to make continuous improvements to the codebase. Contributions are welcome as we build this together!
