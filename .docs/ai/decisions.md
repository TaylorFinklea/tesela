# Architecture Decision Records

Concise log of non-obvious decisions. Newest first.

### 2026-03-30 — Apple-first, web later (platform strategy)

**Decision:** SwiftUI/AppKit is the primary GUI. Use SF Symbols for icons. A Tauri/web app can be built later sharing the Rust backend API, with its own icon set (Tabler/Lucide) mapped from the same frontmatter `icon` field.

**Why:** Taylor is the sole user on macOS. Native AppKit gives the best keyboard-first editing experience. The Rust backend already runs cross-platform. Rewriting in a shared UI framework now would kill momentum for hypothetical users.

**Trade-off:** Two GUI codebases eventually. But the server API is the shared contract, and different icon libraries per platform is normal (like VS Code vs native IDEs).

### 2026-03-27 — Keyboard-navigable select popover (SelectListView)

**Decision:** Replace NSButton-based select popovers with a custom NSView subclass that handles keyDown (arrow/j/k, Enter, Escape) and mouse clicks.

**Why:** Mouse-only popovers broke the keyboard-first UX promise. NSMenu alternatives had target deallocation issues.

**Trade-off:** More custom AppKit code to maintain, but consistent with the Vim-everywhere philosophy.

### 2026-03-27 — Preserve caller frontmatter in store.create()

**Decision:** If content passed to `FsNoteStore::create()` already starts with `---`, write it as-is instead of prepending auto-generated frontmatter.

**Why:** Property and Tag pages created from the SwiftUI app include custom frontmatter (type, value_type, choices). The old behavior doubled the frontmatter block and lost those fields.

**Trade-off:** Callers that pass frontmatter are responsible for including `created` timestamps themselves.

### 2026-03-25 — Properties and Tags as pages, not config files

**Decision:** Adopt Logseq DB model — Tags, Properties, and Values are all markdown pages with YAML frontmatter. No more `types.toml`.

**Why:** "Everything is a page" aligns with Tesela's file-based philosophy. Users can browse, edit, and link to type definitions. Enables property inheritance through `extends` chains.

**Trade-off:** Server must understand Property/Tag page semantics. More complex indexing. But files remain the single source of truth.

---

### 2026-03-20 — Database-first architecture shift

**Decision:** TUI becomes an API client. Local tesela-server runs always. Central server planned for sync.

**Why:** SwiftUI app already uses REST API. Having TUI also use the API means one code path for all clients. Enables future multi-device sync.

**Trade-off:** TUI loses offline-only simplicity. But the server is local, so it's effectively the same.

### 2026-03-15 — Custom NSTextView outliner, not embedded Neovim

**Decision:** Build the block editor from scratch using one NSTextView per block inside an OutlinerView (NSView), wrapped in a single NSViewRepresentable.

**Why:** Embedded Neovim can't do block-aware motions (j/k between blocks, dd deletes block, >> indents hierarchy). WKWebView+TipTap adds web complexity. Native AppKit gives full control over Vim integration.

**Trade-off:** Significant upfront work for the editor. But it's the right long-term investment for keyboard-first UX.
