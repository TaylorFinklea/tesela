# Tesela Roadmap

## What Tesela Is

Keyboard-first note-taking system (org-mode successor). Rust backend + SvelteKit web frontend. Taylor's daily-driver tool — reliability matters more than features.

**Core principle:** Database-first, files are export format. Everything is a page.

**Design quality bar:** Linear × Logseq × Zed — craft, restraint, keyboard-first, dark-mode default.

## Product Vision

Tesela is NOT just an outliner. The long-term vision is a personal knowledge operating system with:

1. **Block outliner with Vim mode** — Zed-quality keybindings, per-block editing, block drill-in
2. **Command palette (⌘K)** — Alfred/Raycast-style universal launcher: search pages, run commands, create notes, navigate
3. **Slash commands (/)** — in-block quick actions: change block type, insert template, add property, convert to task
4. **Space/Leader commands** — Neovim which-key-style hierarchical command menu from Normal mode: `Space f` → file commands, `Space s` → search, `Space g` → graph
5. **Anytype-style type system** — types, relations, and properties are all pages. Tags are classes. Properties are global entities. Blocks inherit property schemas from their tags. Table/kanban/list views per type.
6. **Sidebar + right panel** — Logseq DB layout: left sidebar (pages, recents, favorites, graph, tiles), right sidebar (backlinks, forward links, properties, pinned pages)
7. **Graph view** — force-directed note relationship graph with click-to-navigate
8. **Daily notes timeline** — scrollable tiles view with inline editing
9. **Search** — full-text search with highlighting, match counts, live results

## Architecture

- **Rust workspace** (`crates/`): tesela-core, tesela-cli, tesela-tui, tesela-mcp, tesela-server, tesela-plugins
- **Web app** (`web/`): SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (runes) + TypeScript + CodeMirror 6 + `@replit/codemirror-vim` + Tailwind v4 + TanStack Query (@tanstack/svelte-query) + Tabler Icons
- **Type system**: Tags, Properties, and Values are pages with YAML frontmatter (Logseq DB + AnyType hybrid — see `memory/project_property_system_vision.md` for deep architecture)

## Rust Backend — stable, not blocked

The server + core library are mature. No immediate feature work needed beyond backlog items.

- Block outliner data model, wiki-link + tag + property parsing
- SQLite/FTS5 indexer with incremental reindex
- REST + WebSocket server (`tesela-server`) with ~95% API coverage
- MCP server for AI integration
- CLI, TUI, plugin system (Lua), backup/restore, LogSeq importer
- Type registry with Tag/Property/Value pages and inheritance

## Web Client — Phases

### Phase 1: Core Outliner ✓

Daily-driver outliner with Vim. Migrated from Next.js/React to SvelteKit/Svelte 5 on 2026-04-10.

#### M0–M2 — Core Outliner ✓ (2026-04-09 → 2026-04-11)
- [x] SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 scaffold (migrated from Next.js)
- [x] Block parser, always-editable CM6, block operations
- [x] Vim mode + block operators (dd, yy, p, o, O, >>, <<)
- [x] ⌘K Raycast-style command palette with sections, search highlighting
- [x] Slash commands (/task, /todo, /doing, /done, /heading, /property, /link, /date)
- [x] Space leader menu (hierarchical, which-key style)
- [x] Inline autocomplete for #tags and [[wiki-links]]

### Phase 2: Navigation & Views ✓ (2026-04-12 → 2026-04-14)

- [x] Sidebar: Today/Timeline/Graph/Pages nav, Favorites, Recents, collapse toggle
- [x] Tag page table views: sortable columns, per-column filters, inline property editing
- [x] Right sidebar: properties panel (tags, type, custom), backlinks, forward links
- [x] Logseq-style journal timeline with inline editable blocks per day
- [x] Canvas force-directed graph with tag filters, depth slider, theme-aware colors
- [x] Full-text search with bold match highlighting in command palette
- [x] Favorites system (localStorage, star toggle, sidebar section, command palette)
- [x] Settings page (themes, font size, Vim toggle, server URL, shortcuts reference)
- [x] 6 themes: Day, Evening, Woven, Tile Grid, Depth Layers, Neon Glow

### Phase 3: Power Features (NEXT)

#### Anytype-Style Types & Relations
- [x] Kanban view on tag pages (group by select property like Status)
- [ ] Queries / Sets — saved filters by type + property, displayed as table/list/kanban
- [ ] Collections — manual page groupings
- [ ] Node references — property value links to another page (bidirectional)
- [ ] Tag inheritance — `extends` chain, child inherits parent properties
- [ ] Global property registry — search existing property pages when adding to a tag

#### Editor Power Features
- [x] Visual mode (block-level — V to enter, j/k to extend, d/y/T/J/K)
- [x] Block merge on Backspace at start of non-empty block
- [x] Multi-block selection and operations (visual delete / yank / indent / status / tag)
- [x] `/template` — insert from template pages
- [x] `/date` — date picker UI (with Todoist-style natural-language input)
- [x] Block drill-in (focus single block + children)
- [x] Block fold / collapse (Phase 3K)
- [x] Subtree-aware indent (>>, << bring children with parent)
- [x] Leader Y → OS clipboard (Phase 3K)

#### Polish
- [x] Auto-focus first block on page mount (Phase 3L)
- [x] Esc-in-Normal preserves focused block + cm-editor (Phase 3L)
- [x] 3-region splits with `Ctrl+w h/j/k/l` (left sidebar / outliner / right panel) (Phase 3L)
- [x] Modal focus restore: ⌘K / leader-menu / slash-menu close returns focus to last block (Phase 3L)
- [ ] Right sidebar: inline keyboard property editing (j/k navigates, currently only mouse-clickable)
- [ ] Right sidebar: toggle between page context and block context (focused block's own properties + a useful place for hidden/icon properties like status)
- [ ] Right sidebar: pin pages for split view
- [ ] Empty/loading/error state audit across all views
- [ ] Graph: drag nodes to reposition

### Phase 4: Distribution

#### (Optional) Tauri Wrap
- [ ] Tauri shell serving `web/out/`
- [ ] Menu bar, global hotkeys, system tray

**Deferred:** Whiteboards, long-form prose, mobile/iOS, multi-device sync (CRDTs), App Store, plugin marketplace, collaborative editing.

## Backlog (parallel, tiered by model capability)

<!-- tier3_owner: claude -->

### Haiku (mechanical, no judgment)

- [ ] Replace one-off `regex::Regex::new(r"#[...]")` in `crates/tesela-server/src/routes/notes.rs:179` with cached `INLINE_TAG_RE`
- [ ] Replace `std::env::current_dir().unwrap()` in `crates/tesela-cli/src/main.rs:196` with `?` + `.context()`
- [ ] Replace 2 `plist_file.to_str().unwrap()` calls in `crates/tesela-cli/src/main.rs:666,690` with `.context()`
- [ ] Replace 3 `serde_json::to_string_pretty(&results).unwrap()` calls in `crates/tesela-mcp/src/tools.rs:150,236,260` with `.expect("reason")`
- [ ] Annotate 2 regex-capture unwraps in `crates/tesela-cli/src/import_logseq.rs:202,244` with `.expect("reason")`
- [ ] Annotate `cap.get(0).unwrap()` in `crates/tesela-core/src/link.rs:38` with `.expect("reason")`
- [ ] Extract hardcoded server bind address `"127.0.0.1:7474"` into a named constant
- [ ] Extract hardcoded backup-retention magic numbers into named constants

### Sonnet (some architectural judgment)

- [ ] Split `crates/tesela-core/src/db/sqlite.rs` (1126 lines) into db/migrations.rs, db/search.rs, db/links.rs, db/types.rs
- [ ] Split `crates/tesela-cli/src/main.rs` (826 lines) into `src/commands/` submodule
- [ ] Extract duplicated backup logic into shared `tesela_core::backup` module

### Opus (design skill, cross-cutting)

- [ ] API endpoint integration tests (server routes)
- [ ] New server endpoints needed for web client: `GET /notes/:id/blocks`, `POST /notes/:id/blocks` (block-level CRUD)
- [ ] Block merge with property conflict resolution: when both the merged-from and merged-into blocks have properties, show an overlay dialog letting the user choose which properties to keep (rather than naively concatenating duplicate keys)
- [x] **Outliner-level undo / redo stack** (`u` / `Ctrl+R` for structural ops) — Phase 3M. Snapshot stack in `web/src/lib/stores/outliner-history.svelte.ts`, sprinkled into every structural mutation in BlockOutliner; falls through to cm-editor history when stack empty. Cmd+Z outside vim is a follow-up.
- [ ] Cmd+Z outside vim (document-level keydown that calls the same outliner undo when not inside an editor)
- [ ] Cancel in-flight saves on undo (close the residual race window where a debounced PUT from before the undo overwrites the restored state)
- [ ] **`dw` / `d$` / etc. integrate with `p` paste** (text-register fidelity). Phase 3K's `delete` operator override no-ops the register-controller side of non-linewise deletes, so deleted text isn't recoverable via `p`. Two viable approaches: (a) populate vim's default register via `vimGlobalState.registerController.pushText` (requires importing a non-public symbol from `@replit/codemirror-vim`, may break across versions), or (b) maintain our own text register alongside `blockClipboard`, and have the `pasteBlock` action prefer block clipboard, falling back to text register inserted at cursor. Pick the approach during design; option (b) is friendlier to upgrades.

## Constraints

- Design quality bar: Linear × Logseq × Zed — craft, restraint, keyboard-first, dark-mode default
- No business logic in the web client — only in `tesela-core` traits
- Database-first; files are export format
- Everything is a page — types, properties, tags are all note files
- Icons: Tabler Icons in web client
- Command palette is the primary discovery surface for commands

## Non-Goals (for now)

- iOS/iPadOS app
- Multi-device sync (CRDTs)
- App Store distribution
- Plugin marketplace
- Collaborative editing
- Whiteboards / infinite canvas
