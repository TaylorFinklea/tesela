//! Event handlers module for the TUI
//!
//! This module will contain specialized event handlers and business logic
//! separated from the main app state and UI rendering.
//!
//! Future expansion points:
//! - Advanced keyboard shortcuts and macros
//! - Mouse event handling
//! - Async operations handling
//! - External command integration
