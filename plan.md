# Tesela Development Plan

## Development Strategy

### Core Philosophy
- **Local-first**: Full functionality without internet
- **Cross-platform from day one**: macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Progressive enhancement**: Basic features first, advanced features later
- **Community-driven**: Open source, plugin-friendly

### Outliner Architecture
- **Block-based Structure**: Tesela is an outliner tool where every note consists of blocks starting with `-`
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Child blocks inherit properties from parent blocks (like tags, metadata)
- **Minimal Initialization**: New notes are initialized with frontmatter properties and a single `-` block
- **Content Structure**: All content must be organized as bulleted blocks for proper outliner functionality
- **Future UI Considerations**: The UI version will need to handle block inheritance logic

**Directory Structure:**
```
my-mosaic/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tesela.toml      # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/           # Regular notes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dailies/         # Daily notes (separate from regular notes)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attachments/     # File attachments
```

**Example Note Structure:**
```
---
title: "Example Note"
created: 2025-01-15 10:30:00
last_opened: 2025-01-15 10:30:00
tags: ["example"]
---
- This is a top-level block #important
  - This child inherits the #important tag
  - So does this one
- This is another top-level block
```

### Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1**: Local-only, cross-platform foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Platform-native sync (iCloud, then others)
3. **Phase 3**: Custom sync protocol with collaboration
4. **Phase 4**: AI features and advanced plugins

**Note: All versions before 1.0 are considered alpha releases**

## üéâ V0.3 FOUNDATION COMPLETE! üéâ

### Current Status (v0.3.7)

**‚úÖ Outliner Architecture Implemented**
- All notes use proper outliner format with block-based structure
- Minimal initialization with frontmatter and single `-` block
- Future-ready for block inheritance and hierarchical operations

**‚úÖ Organized Directory Structure** 
- `notes/` for regular topic-based notes
- `dailies/` for date-based daily notes  
- `attachments/` for file attachments
- Clean separation with unified access

**‚úÖ Cross-Directory Functionality**
- Edit, search, and autocomplete work seamlessly across both directories
- Smart title-to-filename mapping for reliable note access
- No duplicate entries in autocomplete suggestions
- Daily notes properly labeled in search results

**‚úÖ Complete CLI Experience**
- All core commands implemented and tested
- Intelligent autocomplete with time-based ordering
- Interactive mode with beautiful TUI
- VIM integration for editing
- Shell completions for all major shells

**‚úÖ Performance & Reliability**
- SQLite indexing with FTS5 full-text search
- File watching and incremental indexing
- Robust error handling and logging
- 48+ unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Ready for Next Phase
Foundation is solid and ready for desktop UI development. All core functionality works reliably with the proper outliner architecture in place.
- ‚úÖ **Import system** for external note formats
- ‚úÖ **Vim integration** - Edit notes in external editor from CLI and interactive mode
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Cycling Autocomplete** - Tab completion with cycling and time-based ordering

### Recent Enhancements (v0.3.1-v0.3.3):
- ‚úÖ **External Editor Integration**: New `tesela edit <note>` command opens notes in vim or $EDITOR
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Interactive Mode**: "Edit note" option now launches external editor instead of just displaying content
- ‚úÖ **Seamless Workflow**: Exit editor returns to interactive mode for continuous note management
- ‚úÖ **Smart Note Selection**: Multiple matches show selection menu in interactive mode
- ‚úÖ **Environment Aware**: Respects $EDITOR environment variable, defaults to vim
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Autocomplete**: Tab completion in interactive mode for all note-related inputs
- ‚úÖ **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Different autocomplete behavior for notes vs search queries
- ‚úÖ **Tag Autocomplete**: Automatically detects and suggests hashtags from existing notes
- ‚úÖ **Search Keywords**: Suggests search operators like `tag:`, `title:`, `created:`, etc.
- ‚úÖ **CLI Autocomplete**: Standalone `tesela autocomplete` command for shell integration
- ‚úÖ **Cycling Completions**: Multiple tab presses cycle through all matching notes
- ‚úÖ **Time-Based Ordering**: Most recently modified notes appear first in autocomplete
- ‚úÖ **Smart Daily Note Navigation**: Easy cycling through daily notes by modification time
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced UX**: Perfect for managing hundreds of notes with instant access to recent ones

### üéØ Enhanced Cycling Autocomplete Demonstration:

**Interactive Mode Cycling Autocomplete:**
```bash
tesela interactive
# Select "üìù Edit note" ‚Üí Type "daily" ‚Üí Press TAB ‚Üí "daily-journal-week-3" (most recent)
# Press TAB again ‚Üí "Daily Journal - Week 3" (title format)
# Press TAB again ‚Üí "daily-journal-week-2" (next most recent)
# Continues cycling through all matches, ordered by modification time!
```

**CLI Autocomplete with Cycling Preview:**
```bash
tesela autocomplete "daily"
# Output shows:
# üí° Tab completion for 'daily':
# üìã Notes are ordered by modification time (most recent first)
#   TAB 1: daily-journal---week-3 ‚Üê First completion
#   TAB 2: Daily Journal - Week 3  
#   TAB 3: daily-journal---week-2
#   TAB 4: Daily Journal - Week 2
# üîÑ In interactive mode:
#    ‚Ä¢ Type 'daily' and press TAB ‚Üí 'daily-journal---week-3'
#    ‚Ä¢ Press TAB again ‚Üí 'Daily Journal - Week 3'
#    ‚Ä¢ Cycles through all 8 matches
```

**Revolutionary UX Features:**
- **Time-Based Priority**: Most recently modified notes appear first in tab completion
- **Cycling Navigation**: Multiple tab presses cycle through ALL matching notes
- **Perfect for Daily Notes**: Type "daily" + TAB to instantly access your most recent entries
- **Handles Scale**: Works perfectly with hundreds of notes - recent ones always accessible
- **Context-Aware**: Different cycling behavior for notes vs search vs linking
- **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced autocomplete command shows exactly how cycling works

### ALL CLI Commands Working:
```bash
tesela init                           # Initialize new mosaic
tesela new "My Note"                  # Create notes
