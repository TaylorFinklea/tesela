# Tesela Development Plan

## Development Strategy

### Core Philosophy
- **Local-first**: Full functionality without internet
- **Cross-platform from day one**: macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Progressive enhancement**: Basic features first, advanced features later
- **Community-driven**: Open source, plugin-friendly

### Outliner Architecture
- **Block-based Structure**: Tesela is an outliner tool where every note consists of blocks starting with `-`
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Child blocks inherit properties from parent blocks (like tags, metadata)
- **Minimal Initialization**: New notes are initialized with frontmatter properties and a single `-` block
- **Content Structure**: All content must be organized as bulleted blocks for proper outliner functionality
- **Future UI Considerations**: The UI version will need to handle block inheritance logic

**Directory Structure:**
```
my-mosaic/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tesela.toml      # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/           # Regular notes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dailies/         # Daily notes (separate from regular notes)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attachments/     # File attachments
```

**Example Note Structure:**
```
---
title: "Example Note"
created: 2025-01-15 10:30:00
last_opened: 2025-01-15 10:30:00
tags: ["example"]
---
- This is a top-level block #important
  - This child inherits the #important tag
  - So does this one
- This is another top-level block
```

### Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1**: Local-only, cross-platform foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Platform-native sync (iCloud, then others)
3. **Phase 3**: Custom sync protocol with collaboration
4. **Phase 4**: AI features and advanced plugins

**Note: All releases are dated. Features are developed incrementally with continuous delivery.**

### Release Strategy

**Automated Continuous Delivery**
- **Automatic Releases**: Every commit to main triggers a new release
- **Date-based Versioning**: Format `0.{YYYY}{MM}{DD}[.{build_number}]`
  - Example: `0.20250115.0` (first release of the day)
  - Example: `0.20250115.1` (second release of the day)
- **Multi-platform Binaries**: Automatic builds for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Release Tracking**: RELEASE.md file maintains complete release history
- **GitHub Actions**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline

**Benefits of Date-based Versioning**
- **Predictable**: Users know exactly when a release was made
- **No Version Debates**: No decisions about major/minor/patch
- **Frequent Releases**: Encourages small, incremental improvements
- **Clear Timeline**: Easy to track feature introduction dates
- **Rollback Friendly**: Easy to identify and revert to specific dates

**Release Artifacts**
- Pre-built binaries for all major platforms
- Automatic changelog generation from commit messages
- Tagged releases for reproducible builds
- RELEASE.md updated with each release

### üéØ Enhanced Cycling Autocomplete Demonstration:

**Interactive Mode Cycling Autocomplete:**
```bash
tesela interactive
# Select "üìù Edit note" ‚Üí Type "daily" ‚Üí Press TAB ‚Üí "daily-journal-week-3" (most recent)
# Press TAB again ‚Üí "Daily Journal - Week 3" (title format)
# Press TAB again ‚Üí "daily-journal-week-2" (next most recent)
# Continues cycling through all matches, ordered by modification time!
```

**CLI Autocomplete with Cycling Preview:**
```bash
tesela autocomplete "daily"
# Output shows:
# üí° Tab completion for 'daily':
# üìã Notes are ordered by modification time (most recent first)
#   TAB 1: daily-journal---week-3 ‚Üê First completion
#   TAB 2: Daily Journal - Week 3
#   TAB 3: daily-journal---week-2
#   TAB 4: Daily Journal - Week 2
# üîÑ In interactive mode:
#    ‚Ä¢ Type 'daily' and press TAB ‚Üí 'daily-journal---week-3'
#    ‚Ä¢ Press TAB again ‚Üí 'Daily Journal - Week 3'
